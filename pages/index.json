    "title": "About me",
    "image": "/colin-macrae.jpg",
    "primary": "Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer currently immersing myself in the dynamic realm of front-end development. Hailing from Orange County, CA, my journey into the world of coding began with a pivotal career change sparked by insightful conversations with developer friends. Encouraged by their enthusiasm, I delved into self-learning and formal education, completing an accelerated software development program at LearningFuze.",
    "secondary": "My initial curiosity evolved into a deep-seated enjoyment of coding, leading me to commit full-time to becoming a proficient developer. Prior to this transformative career shift, I had diverse experiences in Taiwan, where I navigated roles ranging from branding consulting and project management to writing/editing academic journals and ESL materials, procurement, quality assurance, and English teaching. In the midst of this, I pursued my passion for Mandarin Chinese, earned my MBA, and dedicated time to cycling competitionsâ€”all while relishing the unique charm of Taiwan and its wonderful people."
