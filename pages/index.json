    "image": "/colin-macrae.jpg",
    "primary": "I’m a full-stack developer with a front-end focus, currently based in Orange County, CA. My journey into tech began after a career shift from diverse roles in Taiwan—including branding, project management, and ESL teaching—while also earning an MBA. Now, I specialize in building scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Currently at Teamshares, I own the main website prject for Massachussets Commercial Cleaning, where I lead junior engineers on the project and handled client communications, while rebuilding the company website with modern tech stacks like serverless forms (EmailJS).  I also worked with The Daily Wire to develop their 2024 Elections Hub for the Presidential & General Election, handling high-traffic needs and researching voter tools. I also contribute as a volunteer web developer for Hack for LA, maintaining open-source projects through code reviews and agile collaboration.",
    "secondary": "Beyond coding, I bring a unique blend of cross-disciplinary experience—from academic writing and procurement to quality assurance—along with a passion for Mandarin Chinese and competitive cycling. My background in varied industries helps me approach problems creatively, whether optimizing workflows, improving UX, or delivering clean, maintainable code. I thrive in collaborative environments while continuously expanding my technical skills."
